# Interactive-Mapping: Vancouver Food Stalls & Public Bathrooms

In this lab, my goal was to use turf.js to add interactivity to a map of public bathrooms in the city. I decided it would be useful to know the nearest location of a public bathroom to a food stall. These are things like hot dog stands, where vendors sell food on the street in carts, meaning that they aren't restaurants and so they don't have built in washrooms. I attempted to use the turf.js function "nearestPoint" so that you could click on a food stall, and it would highlight the nearest public bathroom. UNFORTUNATELY, I got really, really stuck, and I just can't figure out where I went wrong. So the function doesn't work :( I will continue to try and tinker with the code for the next couple days, but I figured I need to at least hand something in now.
